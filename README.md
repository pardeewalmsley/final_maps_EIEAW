# Final print maps "The Early Islamic Empire at Work"

This repo contains a series of illustrative maps designed for ERC research project "The Early Islamic Empire at Work", based at the University of Hamburg.

Guide to what is included in this folder:

1. BASE MAPS (N=18) - a series of natural-colour base maps for all regions of the project. Some regions have more or fewer base maps based on needs of individual team members.

2. MENTAL MAPS (N=53) - a series of maps illustrating the administrative conceptions of different historic geographers. For each region, I have also included a legend that can be added in wherever appropriate. I have also produced two versions for each region: one with concave hulls encompassing the points, and one without. 

3. ADMINISTRATIVE MAPS (N=6) - a series of maps showing the administrative structures in place in Fars during different periods. Legend and list of sites also included. 

4. OTHER (N=1) - So far, this folder contains only a single special-purpose map I made for al-Yaman.

5. EXAMPLES - A mock-up version of some selected maps at print dimensions. The size of the document page is the same as the De Gruyter "Medium Book" format, so the maps can be seen as they would appear on the page in real life.
